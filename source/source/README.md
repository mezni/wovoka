## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|     Method           |Endpoint                          |Description                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|POST   |/api/v1/auth/register            |Register a new user           |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|
